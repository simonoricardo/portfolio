    I have been passionate about photography since childhood. I cherish the ability to capture timeless moments and present them as I truly remember them.
    It's often said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and a single image can convey so many emotions.

    I started my journey with a Nikon D3000 and then upgraded to a Nikon D300. Eventually, I transitioned to the Fuji system.
    Currently, I own a Fuji X100V and a Fuji XT-10, equipped with a 90mm prime lens, a 55-230mm zoom lens, and the 16-50mm kit lens.

    There's something unique about Fuji cameras. The way they render JPEGs, the film simulations, and the compact size of their mirrorless models all contribute to the joy of shooting with them.
